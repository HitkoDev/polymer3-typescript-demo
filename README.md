# Get started
```bash
# Clone this project
git clone https://github.com/HitkoDev/polymer3-typescript-demo.git polymer-demo
cd polymer-demo
# Polymer 3 uses ES6 imports, and requires a flat structure to work (dev dependencies should keep the tree structure though)
yarn
# Starts TypeScript compiler, Gulp watch, and Polymer dev server
npm run dev
```

This will start a polymer dev server, and you can open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see Polymer 3 in action.
